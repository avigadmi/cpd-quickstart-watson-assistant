### Running locally

The following steps are for running locally with Node.js. You can also run locally with Docker.

1. To develop locally, first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ([LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) supported versions).

1. At the command line, go to your project directory.

1. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the app:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

1. Point your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Testing the app

After your app is installed and running, experiment with it to see how it responds.

The chat interface is on the left, and the JSON that the JavaScript code receives from the Watson Assistant service is on the right. Your questions and commands are interpreted using a small set of sample data trained with the banking intents:
